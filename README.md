# Clustering on MNIST Dataset

This notebook demonstrates the application of clustering techniques on the MNIST dataset, a collection of handwritten digits. The project utilizes Gaussian Mixture Models and K-Means clustering to identify and visualize clusters of digits based on pixel intensity values.

# Key Steps:

- Data Preprocessing: Scaling the pixel values for better model performance.
- Gaussian Mixture Model: Implementing an EM algorithm to identify clusters and map them to actual digit labels.
- K-Means Clustering: Testing various numbers of clusters and evaluating model performance through precision, recall, and accuracy metrics.
- Visualization: Displaying cluster representative images to understand the digit patterns in each cluster.

This project serves as a basic exploration of clustering techniques in machine learning and is suitable for beginners looking to understand data clustering concepts.
